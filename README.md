# 🕶️ Hacker Game (C++)

This is a terminal-based game developed in C++ where the player takes the role of a hacker who must complete tasks while avoiding detection. The project explores key data structures such as heaps, trees, and custom queues to manage tasks, risks, and rewards dynamically.

## 🎮 Game Features

- 🗂️ Task scheduling with priorities using a **min-heap**
- ⚠️ Detection risk system that evolves based on player actions
- 💰 Randomized rewards and risk adjustments
- 🌳 Internal game logic using **custom data structures**
- 🧠 Designed for practicing algorithms and system design in C++

## 🚀 Technologies

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Terminal I/O
- Object-Oriented Programming

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Apply abstract data structures (heap, tree, queue) in a game context
- Practice C++ memory management and class design
- Simulate real-time decision making and risk balancing
